## üìù Flag Syntax

### üéØ Instant Flags

For instant show flags like `effectmaster-enter`, use:

```
<show_category> <show_name>
```

**Example:**
```
mainhub welcome
```

> This will play the show located in the `mainhub` category with the name `welcome`.

---

### ‚è±Ô∏è Delayed Flags

For delayed flags like `effectmaster-delay-enter`, use:

```

<show_category> <show_name> <delay_ticks>

```

**Example:**
```

mainhub welcome 20

```

> This plays the `mainhub:welcome` show **after 20 ticks (1 second)**.

## üóÇÔ∏è Region Setup Example

1. Select a region using WorldEdit:
```
//wand
[select area]
```

2. Define a region:
```
/rg define magic_room
```

3. Add a flag:
```
/rg flag magic_room em-enter mainhub welcome
```

4. (Optional) Add a delayed version:
```
/rg flag magic_room em-delay-exit mainhub goodbye 2000
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Flags are **case-sensitive** ‚Äî make sure your category and show names match exactly.
- Multiple regions with overlapping flags will **each trigger**.
