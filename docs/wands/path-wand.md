The **Path Wand** helps you visually and interactively define smooth paths for effects like particle trails, animatronic movements, or any sequence-based effect.

This wand is designed to make the creation of **spline-based paths** simple and intuitive ‚Äî all from in-game.

## üéØ Getting the Wand

Use the following command to get the wand:

```
/em wand path
```

This gives you a special item that lets you place and manage control points in the world.

## üìê Spline Types

You can choose how your path behaves by selecting a **spline type**. Available types:

* `BEZIER`: Path goes in an extremely smooth line but doesn't go over each point.
* `CATMULL_ROM`: Path goes from point to point in a curved line.
* `POLY`: Path goes from point to point in a straight line.

Each type affects how smoothly the path is interpolated between control points.
