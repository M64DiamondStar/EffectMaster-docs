## What are presets?
Presets let you save complex or frequently used effects under a custom name. This makes it easy to retrieve and re-use them in other shows without recreating the effect from scratch.

## Saving a preset
1. Open the effect editor for the effect you want to save.
2. Click **Save as Preset**.
3. Enter a name and choose a display material.

## Using a preset
1. Open the show editor for the show where you want to add the effect.
2. Click **New Effect**.
3. Right-click on the effect type you created a preset for.
4. Select the preset you want to use.

## Managing presets
If you have too many presets, you can remove them directly from the preset UI:

1. Follow the steps in **Using a preset** until you see your presets.
2. Instead of selecting a preset, right-click it twice.
3. The preset will be removed from the list.
