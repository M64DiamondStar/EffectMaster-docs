## My fountain isn't going to the right direction!

First of all, check if your `Velocity` parameter is actually set correctly. If you've already verified that, then check
if the location at which your effect spawns, isn't against another block. The hitbox of a falling block is always a full
block, no matter which material you use.

## "The value entered is not possible"

You may get this error when you're using specific mods or plugins (like a chat decoration plugin which modifies the
player message). As an alternative, you can use the enter command: `/em enter <value....>`.

## Something else...
