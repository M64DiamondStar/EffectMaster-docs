You've reached the final page of the **EffectMaster** docs. Congratulations! I hope you're enjoying using EffectMaster
as much as Iâ€™ve enjoyed building it. Countless hours have gone into making this plugin the best it can be, and it's
available **completely free** for everyone.

If you've found EffectMaster helpful or valuable, and youâ€™d like to support its ongoing development, any donation is
greatly appreciated. Your generosity helps keep the project alive, free, and continuously improving!
