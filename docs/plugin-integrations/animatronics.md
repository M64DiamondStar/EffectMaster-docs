This plugin simply allows you to use Animatronics and Animatronic Groups in your shows! You can check out
the [Animatronic](../effects/animatronic.md "mention")
and [Animatronic Group](../effects/animatronic-group.md "mention") effects!

Of course, you'll also need to install
the [Animatronics](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/animatronics-animate-armorstands-1-8-1-20-2.36518/) plugin.
